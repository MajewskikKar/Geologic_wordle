This beta project is a loose geological interpretation of "wordle" game.
The next step in making the game more useful will be to add pygame features.
The basis of this code is tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyWeex-S6d0. Great thanks @pixelgami for sharing this great piece of code!

The project at glance:
1. This version of the game is still in initial phase and allow you to play in your python terminal (in my case pycharm was used).
2. Whole code is in english but from the "user site" everything is in polish.
3. File "dicition.py" allows to check if the word written by the user occurs in polish dictionary.
4. File "słowa.xls" constist multiple polish geological words. Words were choosen with help of "Słownik geologii dynamicznej". File will be filled with more words in the near future
